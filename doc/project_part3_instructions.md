# Project  Part III (due Dec 2, 2024)

Complete your project by finishing any work remaining from part II and implementing a client/browser side for the application.



You may alter the server and change the API calls used from part II. You may decide not to use some calls, and to implement or alter others. 

You should complete 8 features as indicated in part II.

Revise your README file from part II to reflect any of the changes made to complete the project.

The README should also contain the following information:

* location of the demo video
* any information needed to configure and run your project
* the database and collection names used (so they can be deleted after using your project)
* the status of the project: list which features are working (or partially working) and which are not working. 
* Indication of the API calls and unit tests associated with each feature should be updated from part II submission.

Push the project submission elements (except for the video) to the project repo before the deadline. 
 
## Evaluation

Only aspects of the submission the marker can reasonably understand from your README and video demo will be credited.

DO NOT include the video in the repo, as it will be too large. Include a link or reference to the video file so the marker can view it.

Credit will be equally divided among 8 features, portioned as follows:

For each of 8 features:

* 2 points: sufficient client side HTML code and structure for feature operation  (HTML, css, js)
* 2 points: sufficient server-side code to support feature
* 2 points: code structure and implementation client side (HTML, css, js)
* 2 points: code structure and implementation server side
* 2 points: unit tests correctly demonstrate updated HTTP/API services (those finally used to support feature) are working
* 6 points: video demo and running code demonstrate working code as operated from client-side interface

NOTE there is no weight for web page layout or aesthetics, as we did not cover those matters in class session. However the basic appearance of a kanban board is expected to be implemented.

* 16 x 8 = 128 points total
