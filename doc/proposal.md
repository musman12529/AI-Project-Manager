# Proposal: Task-Tracking Web Application

## 1. Description
This project aims to create a task-tracking web application that allows users to manage tasks through a list view and a kanban-style board view. The core features will include task creation, editing, and viewing task history at any point in time. Users will also be able to move tasks across different states or columns, similar to GitHub Projects, but with additional features like task history at any given time.

From a developerâ€™s perspective, the project will involve building a server-side component that handles task management, including maintaining historical task data, and a front-end interface that presents tasks in various formats. The server will handle user authentication, task management, and history tracking, while the client will offer an intuitive interface for users to view and manage their tasks.

- **Diagram 2: Board View**
  - A drag-and-drop interface where tasks are displayed as cards under different status columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed").
  - Users can move tasks between different columns to change their status.
